# All RANDOM instances: throughput progress

Started 2026-09-21T02:17:27.230561+00:00. The user expanded the campaign to RANDOM-01..05;
RANDOM-05 still targets4,000. Large maps are outside active development.

## Comparison rules

- Full archived horizons600/600/800/1000/2000;32 workers on16 physical EPYC9354 cores,1s entry,30s preprocessing,32GB guard.
- Throughput primary; retain completed/unfinished waiting statistics for promoted records.
- Keep general algorithm/configuration trials separate from instance-specific tricks. Every trick needs the matching `--trick RANDOM-0N`.
- Apply general variants across all five densities before claiming broad benefit. Selecting different settings by instance name counts as a trick. Geometry-independent density rules remain hypotheses until tested.
- Preserve all original failures. Selected maxima, paired planner-seed means and fresh task/start validation are distinct.
- The five cases share one layout; improvements across densities do not establish transfer to unseen geometry.
- Inputs50001–50008 remain excluded from tuning. Future fresh-input protocols must precede generation.

## Current records

| Instance | Robots | Steps | General profile | Trick profile | Matched NMS32 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| RANDOM-01 | 100 | 600 | 651 | 628 | 649 |
| RANDOM-02 | 200 | 600 | 1106 | 1122 | 1228 |
| RANDOM-03 | 400 | 800 | 1582 | 2171 | 2359 |
| RANDOM-04 | 700 | 1000 | 1558 | 2462 | 2580 |
| RANDOM-05 | 800 | 2000 | 2226 | 3978 | 3172 |

The initial records come from the [frozen transfer](GENERALIZATION.md). The
RANDOM-05 trick record includes subsequent development; its complete history
continues in [RANDOM05_PROGRESS.md](../RANDOM05_PROGRESS.md). Configurations,
hashes and evidence are pinned in [random-frontiers.json](random-frontiers.json).

## First declared experiments

Source79 (`9e9dbfa`, build79) runs23 full cases. Three general variants use
noise50, dispersion0, or both, identically across all five densities. They test
whether RANDOM-05 exploration and crowd-spreading settings overshoot lower
densities. These are general configuration experiments, not asserted gains.

Separately, RANDOM-01..03 get a horizon-only trick with guidance still off.
RANDOM-04 receives individual tests of contrast1.6, dispersion0.4, noise100,
move bias2 and a larger K24480 search. Other settings are frozen. Each such
run has its explicit instance flag. The RANDOM-05 move-bias experiments continue.

Further work will consider a windowed multi-step optimizer for sparse/medium
traffic if tuning the reactive policy leaves a structural gap. No such optimizer
has been added yet.

## September21: first development comparisons

All29 original runs are strict full-horizon successes and independently replayed.
Their source is [9e9dbfa](https://github.com/fywu85/lorr/commit/9e9dbfa), build79.
General settings are algorithmic variants, not an automatic map-to-configuration
selector. Choosing settings by instance name will require an explicit trick flag.

| General variant | RANDOM-01 | RANDOM-02 | RANDOM-03 | RANDOM-04 | RANDOM-05 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Frozen pipeline | 647 | 1079 | 1582 | 1558 | 2226 |
| Priority noise50 | 640 | 1066 | 1577 | 1495 | 1930 |
| Dispersion0 | 646 | 1106 | 1573 | 1459 | 2024 |
| Both | 646 | 1105 | 1560 | 1444 | 1978 |
| Three-action policy, K128 | 645 | 989 | 1084 | not run | not run |
| Three-action policy, K512 | 651 | 1038 | 1186 | not run | not run |

The action-policy trial reaches651 at100robots but loses at200/400. Removing
crowd spreading improves RANDOM-02 modestly, while harming denser cases. Neither
change establishes broad improvement. A new optional rolling-window LNS planner
is under regression testing to address the lower-density routing gap.

Explicit horizon-only tricks on RANDOM-01/02/03 score628/1063/1667. The current
RANDOM-05 cutoff scale is unhelpful for the two sparse cases. On RANDOM-04,
contrast1.6/dispersion0.4/noise100/move bias2/K24480 score2267/2421/2358/2436/2462,
versus2456 for the frozen trick recipe and2580 for matched NMS. The six-task
K24480 gain is a selected result, not a replicated effect.

Source, input hashes, allocation, deadlines, RAM, action replay and completed /
unfinished order latency are stored in the
[density audit](results/random-density-first-split-full-v79/audit.json) and
[action-policy audit](results/random-operations-split-full-v79/audit.json).
