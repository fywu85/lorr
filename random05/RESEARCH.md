# Follow-up directions for RANDOM-05

Updated 2026-09-20. These are research hypotheses, not benchmark gains.

## Reuse and repair multi-action operations

The 2024 winner's authors describe EPIBT with short action sequences, bounded
revisits, and inheritance of unexecuted operations. Their tests include800
robots on this map, but use fixed per-agent task sequences and a1000-step
horizon, so their scores are not combined-track comparisons.

MIT license. The local checkout is `/tmp/r05-epibt-reference`; an optional operation policy now adapts its reservation/revisit structure.
The MIT notice is retained under `licenses/EPIBT-MIT.txt`.

A possible controlled adaptation would add an optional three-step operation
kernel beneath our existing rollout search and scheduler. It must preserve an
entire valid inherited plan as fallback, reserve both vertices and edges at
all three times, bound revisits, and carry future operations through the
selected rollout into the next real step. This is more flexible than our
failed all-or-nothing intent-component policy. Start with collision and
inheritance regressions, then compare fixed work and full2000-step results.

## Guidance directions versus cost scale

Mixed Guidance Graph Optimization separates edge-direction choices from their
weights and enforces strong connectivity. Its direction mutation operators
include edges, neighborhoods and cycles. This suggests local changes around
our successful generated field, rather than only drawing unrelated fields.
[Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23468).

Our fixed-normalization-reference experiment isolates counterflow price from
preferred-edge scale, but its K128 gain disappeared at K1024. It does not yet
justify a new field or hard one-way restrictions.

## Current bounded tests

- Penalize adjacent opposite rotations in rollout evaluation; track the previous
  executed action across real steps so the boundary is scored correctly.
- Increase local priority-refinement trials while keeping the global search fixed.
- Mutate priorities inside one spatial neighborhood per candidate, retaining a
  quarter of fully fresh global candidates. Radius0 preserves the existing
  portfolio. This tests whether global mutations disrupt too many independent
  movements for the look-ahead score to retain useful local changes.

Promote only full valid runs. Record a single-seed maximum separately from
replicated planner-seed means and from fresh-instance validation.

Full K1024 tests now reject all listed rotation-penalty, extra-local-search and
regional-mutation settings on the control seed. Startup length preferences also
lose. These optional paths remain off; see RANDOM05_PROGRESS.md for exact scores.

## Three-step prototype

`R05_OPERATIONS=3` uses precomputed action sequences grouped by identical vertex
reservation footprints. It ranks their headings against our exact task-chain
costs, reserves vertices and opposite-edge exclusions for all three times,
and allows bounded lower-priority revisits with rollback to inherited plans.
The remaining valid suffix is carried into the next simulated and real step.
The existing pipeline remains the default. Unlike the upstream timer-driven
search, this integration completes a fixed rollout count and reports a timeout
if the entry deadline is exceeded. Full performance evidence is pending.

A one-visit ablation stalled in the dense toy simulation after redundant turns
were removed. It is rejected as a performance candidate. The selected four-visit
policy and its no-inheritance ablation retain the full mobility/collision
regressions; no liveness guarantee is claimed for arbitrary revisit settings.
