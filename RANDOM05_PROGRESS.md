# RANDOM-05 combined-track throughput progress

Goal: approach the colleague's reported roughly 27–28% gain over matched NMS
combined-track runs, then improve further. Their 3,531 and 3,715 task counts use
private synthetic instances; those absolute counts are reference targets, not
direct baselines for the archived competition instance.

## Comparison rules

- RANDOM-05: 800 robots, 2,000 simulation steps, combined planner and scheduler.
- Compare both solvers on the same input hashes, horizon and CPU allocation.
- Record valid completion, planner/scheduler errors, entry timeouts, latency,
  CPU use and peak process RAM. Our implementation must fit within 32 GB.
- Map-specific guidance and known-horizon triage require `--trick RANDOM-05`.
  Reassignment of unopened tasks is a legitimate combined-track scheduling rule.
- Fixed-work screens accelerate development. Full runs determine the frontier.
- Record every new best, including a seed-specific or trick-enabled result,
  alongside its source commit/hash and UTC timestamp. Distinguish that best from
  replicated improvements across seeds.

## Verified local frontier

Initial valid prototype best: **54 tasks**, followed by gridlock. This is a
starting point, far below the target. The full NMS reference is running.

| Completed UTC | Source commit | Configuration / seed | Tasks / 2,000 | Matched NMS | Gain | Evidence |

## Reference evidence supplied by the user

| Colleague instance seed | Their combined solver | NMS better local build | Gain |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 41001 | 3,715 | 2,932 | 26.7% |
| 41002 | 3,531 | 2,762 | 27.8% |

Both are reported 4-core / one-second runs with a known 2,000-step horizon.
The published NMS score of 3,050 used different instances and hardware.

## Development record

- 2026-09-20: started an isolated `random05/` backend from the supplied log.
  Snapshot the existing simulator while replacing the planner and scheduler.
  Initial implementation: collision-certified pipelining, exact oriented task
  chain costs, joint greedy matching, deterministic rollout portfolios, generic
  dead-end evacuation and coordinated cycle moves. Benchmark evidence pending.

- Initial v1 runs exposed exponential backtracking in the first PIBT executor.
  Progress froze and rollouts exhausted their expansion caps. These are failed
  implementation runs, not a performance frontier. Replaced rollback search
  with standard PIBT failure propagation and committed blocking waits.

- Corrected failure propagation passes the dense regression. The first
  full-size gridlock persists despite changing guidance. Idle-turn preparation
  is the next diagnosed mechanism to investigate. All four v4 runs complete
  2,000 steps without planner errors, schedule errors, or entry timeouts.
