# Controlled CGAR factor matrix

Archived inputs and declared planner seeds, frozen factor profiles. Throughput comparisons require full horizons. Shared hosts and32decimalGB; exact enforced entry limit is recorded above. Simulator validates decisions; complete movement counters and waiting events are reconciled, not an independent full-action replay. No matched NMS or SoTA claim.

Enforced entry limit: 1000ms. Planner seeds: [0].

Throughput is primary; fairness is a secondary reported metric. The separate RANDOM-05 solver is untouched.
