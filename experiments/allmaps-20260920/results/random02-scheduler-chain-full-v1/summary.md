# Controlled CGAR factor matrix

Archived inputs and declared planner seeds, frozen factor profiles. Throughput comparisons require full horizons. Shared hosts and32decimalGB; exact enforced entry limit is recorded above. Simulator validates decisions; complete movement counters and waiting events are reconciled, not an independent full-action replay. No matched NMS or SoTA claim.

Enforced entry limit: 1000ms. Planner seeds: [2].

| Instance / variant / seed | Tasks | Mean ms | Max ms | RSS GB | Outstanding age p90 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| RANDOM-02 / trick_current_control / seed2 | 1215 | 271.21 | 340.94 | 0.139 | 440 |
| RANDOM-02 / trick_exact_chain_assignment / seed2 | 1200 | 279.92 | 360.7 | 0.143 | 492 |

Throughput is primary; fairness is a secondary reported metric. The separate RANDOM-05 solver is untouched.
